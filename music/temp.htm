<p>Project Description </p>
<p>Music notation is presently transmitted over the Web in graphic formats (PDF, 
  GIF, etc.). For people who use screen readers, refreshable Braille displays 
  or text to speech systems, this means that the information cannot be read or 
  edited. </p>
<p>Existing File Formats For Music Notation: </p>
<p>NIFF: A format know as NIFF (Notation Interchange File Format) was completed 
  in the fall of 1995. This is a standard digital format for the representation 
  of standard musical notation. The format is very flexible, allowing for simple 
  implementations with minimal graphical information, or much more elaborate descriptions 
  including all aspects of page layout, associated midi data, custom symbols, 
  etc. The NIFF Consortium has also developed at freely available SDK for software 
  developers implementing NIFF. </p>
<p>TILIA: Another popular file format developed by the CERL research group, at 
  the University of Illinois, is an extensible music notation format called TILIA. 
  The CERL group have also created a notation editor available in the public domain 
  called LIME. LIME includes a NIFF import, export utility. </p>
<p>Possible Access Solutions for Users with Disabilities: </p>
<p>The NIDE project is researching two possible alternatives for to provide access 
  solutions for users with disabilities: </p>
<p>1. Integration of Existing Tools </p>
<p>A US based corporation named Dancing Dots Braille Music Technology (http://www.dancingdots.com/) 
  have developed a utility that translates TILIA and NIFF files into Braille notation. 
  Our research indicates that it is possible to integrate the LIME editor and 
  Dancing Dot utility into courseware authoring modules, to allow the creation 
  of accessible music curriculum by educators. Alternatively, CakeWalk (http://www.cakewalk.com/) 
  version 8.0 Music Software can be used with CakeTalk (from Dancing Dots) which 
  are JAWS scripts for audio output. </p>
<p>The following steps would be required by the user of this access strategy: 
</p>
<p> Download the LIME editor  Define MIME type </p>
<p> Author resources to be embedded in online music curriculum </p>
<p> SmartScore or MIDISCAN implementation (OCR for music notation) </p>
<p> Output using Dancing Dots (GoodFeel) software or CakeWalk (http://www.cakewalk.com/), 
  which can be used with CakeTalk JAWS scripts </p>
<p>This strategy is considered to be a short term solution, and is problematic 
  as the user must download components, purchase proprietary software and complete 
  a relatively complex series of steps in order to access the music notation. 
  It is the goal of this project to develop methods that present a more transparent 
  interface to the user. </p>
<p>2. Development of MusicML </p>
<p>Several XML languages have been initiated to render music notation via the 
  Web. One of these is known as MusicML. The NIDE project is currently researching 
  the existing MusicML DTDs to determine which will provide the best foundation 
  for multimodal, accessible rendering of the content. Our intent is to develop 
  an integrated group of utilities to seamlessly provide access to musical notation. 
  The components being developed include: </p>
<p> XML DTD (Music ML) Language for authoring and rendering music notation </p>
<p> Accessible onscreen keyboard that writes to XML and creates Midi files </p>
<p> Accessible Java applet for rendering notation in visual, audio and other 
  alternative formats </p>
<p>An example of MusicML being used in conjunction with a Java applet may be seen 
  on the Music ML an XML Experience site (http://195.108.47.160/3.0/musicml/index.html) 
</p>
<p>Musical Memories Database: </p>
<p>Work is underway to integrate a music notation editor with a web site for the 
  collection and distribution of music pieces among senior citizens. In partnership 
  with Continuing Education at Ryerson Polytechnic University, we will building 
  on the current LIFE (Learning is Forever) http://ce-online.ryerson.ca/ce/ web 
  site at to test the possibility of distributed music collaboration. The music 
  will be archived dynamically as notation, midi files and lyrics. The user interface 
  will allow seniors to annotate, add to and edit remembered music. </p>
<p>The functional specifications for the site include: </p>
<p> the user should be able to create a new record or edit an old record </p>
<p> each record can contain: lyrics, digital audio recordings of the musical 
  piece, music notation or midi files </p>
<p> the user should be able to input lyrics, annotations to existing lyrics, 
  and alternatives lyrics linked to the same file </p>
<p> the user should be able to record an audio file of the musical piece and 
  place it in sequence in relation to the other data about a single musical piece 
</p>
<p> the user should be able to enter simple notation of the musical piece and 
  display this in an accessible format  the user should be able to dynamically 
  create a midi file of the piece through mechanisms such as on on-line interactive 
  piano keyboard. </p>
