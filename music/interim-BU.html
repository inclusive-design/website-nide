As this technology   is still being developed, the publisher of music notation   on the world wide web must resort to other methods   to provide access to the material.</p><h2>Interim Methods</h2><ol>  <li><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></li>  <li><a href="#mime">Setting a MIME type for Lime files</a></li>  <li><a href="#example">Example of online music notation</a></li></ol><a name="intro"></a> <p>Currently music notation is rendered on the world   wide web in a graphical format. This way of rendering   music notation is only accessible visualy. In order   to provide the music notation in a way that users   of alternative interfaces can access the publisher   of the notation should provide the notational format   linked to the picture. This will also allow the user   to access the notation in an editable format which   is useful for disseminating online music curriculum.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/">Lime   Notation Editor</a> is a piece of shareware developed   at the University of Illinois by the CERL Sound Group.   In addition to being an affordable editor the Lime   format has been used by <a href="http://www.dancingdots.com">Dancing   Dots</a>, a company developing access to music notation   for users with visual impairments. For this reason   it is recommended that the publisher of music notation   use either the Lime notation format or NIFF (notational   interchange file format) which can also be read by   Lime.</p><p>Setting the MIME type of a Lime file in the users browser will make it easier   for the user to consume music curriculum by enabling the browser to automatically   open the file in the notation editor. Here is a description of the process.</p><h3><a name="mime"></a>To point this file to the Lime   notation editor from your browser follow these steps:</h3><h4>For Netscape 4.x on Mac</h4><ol>  <li>Open &quot;Preferences&quot; from the Edit menu of your Netscape browser.</li>  <li>Select &quot;Applications&quot; from the &quot;Navigator&quot; category.</li>  <li>Click the new button.</li>  <li>Fill out the &quot;Edit Type&quot; dialog box as follows:     <dl>       <dd><img src="edit.jpg" width="426" height="384" alt="Edit Type dialog box,Description&#61; Lime file, Suffix&#61; lime, Application is selected and set toLime 6.00, File type is set to Lime, Macintosh File is selected"></dd>    </dl>  </li>  <br>  <li> Click Choose after selecting the &quot;Application&quot; radio button and     select your Lime notation editor.   <li>Click &quot;OK&quot; in the Edit Type dialog and the &quot;Preference&quot;     dialog. </ol><h4>For Internet Explorer 5.x on Mac</h4><ol>  <li>Open Preferences from the Edit menu of your Microsoft browser.</li>  <li>Select &quot;File Helpers&quot; from the &quot;Receiving Files&quot; category.</li>  <li>Click the add button.</li>  <li>Fill out the &quot;Edit File Helper&quot; dialog box as follows:     <dl>       <dd><img src="file.jpg" alt="Edit File Helper dialog box; Description = Lime; Extinsion = .lim; Application = Lime 6.00; File type = Lime; File creator = LIME"></dd>    </dl>  </li></ol><h4>For Netscape 4.x on Windows</h4><ol>  <li>Choose &quot;Preferences&quot; from the the &quot;Edit&quot; menu</li>  <li>Select &quot;Applications&quot; and click the &quot;New Type&quot; button.</li>  <li>Fill out the &quot;New Type&quot; dialog box as follows and click &quot;OK&quot;:	<dl>	  <dd><img src="win_net.jpg" alt="type = Lime; dialog box description of File extension = .lim; Application to use = lime.exe"></dd>	</dl>  </li></ol><h4>For Internet Explorer 5.x on Windows</h4><p>Note that Internet Explorer uses the file type definition   found in Windows Explorer. If Lime has already been   installed on the machine the MIME type will already   be set. However if the user does need to create or   make adjustments to this information they can use   the following steps.</p><ol>  <li>Open Windows Explorer and choose &quot;Folder     Options&quot; from the &quot;View&quot; menu.</li>  <li>Select &quot;File Types&quot; and click on &quot;New     Type&quot;</li>  <li>After you fill out the &quot;Add New File Type&quot;     dialog box it should look something like this:     <dl>	  <dd><img src="win_ie.jpg" alt="Add New File Type dialog; Description of type = Lime; Associated extension = .lim Actions = lime.exe"></dd>	</dl>  </li></ol><h3><a name="example"></a>Example of online music notation</h3><p>Click the image to download a Lime file.</p><p><a href="music.lim"> <img src="music.gif" width="542" height="285" border="0" alt="Musical example of &quot;Mary had a little Lamb&quot;"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
