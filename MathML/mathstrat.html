<h2>ATRC MathML Stylesheet Strategy</h2>

<p>The ATRC is currently involved in the creation of a set of
stylesheets to transform MathML into a formatted speech mark-up. 
This project is being executed in technical collaboration
with IBM's T. J. Watson Research Centre.</p>

<p>The stylesheets will be authored in XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language),
a specification from the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a> designed for
the tranlation from one XML language into another. XSL is a universal technology,
quickly becoming supported on all platforms, and in both major browsers.</p>

<p>These XSL stylesheets will be used (initially, at least) to convert the MathML
code into the Java Speech Mark-up Language. JSML was chosen because it is 
a fairly well supported cross-platform language. Converting the stylesheets
to output some other speech format (For example: SSML or CSS2 formatted XHTML)
should be trivial.</p>

<p>The ATRC will author broad and encompassing stylesheets, sufficient to render
all available mathematical notations in some manner - these stylesheets will make no assumptions
whatsoever about the context or meaning of the supplied MathML, and hence will do little
better than a linear listing of all elements.</p>

<p>More in-depth processing may be added through the creation of additional stylesheets, 
overiding the transformation rules specified in the first. These rules may be created by
anyone, including the user, and linked to the system, hence allowing for a user-controlled
context selection. If the user knows she is within the context of a particular field, then she
may load an appropriarte stylesheet for that domain. Or, if the user has some preference
for how a particular expression or class of expressions is to be read, she may load her own
user defined stylesheet for her purposes.</p>

<p>The following two examples of readings of the normalized Gaussian illustrate this idea: The <a href="gauss.wav">first</a>
assumes no context and applies no special rules: it uses only the inforation
supplied by the MathML tags. The <a href="gauss2.wav">second</a> is the precise same MathML source, but 
has been processed with three additional rules:
<ul>
  <li> <b> <i>[exp]</i> / 2 </b> -----------> <b>one-half <i>[exp]</i> </b></li>
  <li><b><i>[exp]</i>  raised 2</b> -------------> <b><i>[exp]</i>  squared</b></li>
  <li><b><i>[nothing]</i> - <i>[exp]</i> </b> -------------> <b>negative <i>[exp]</i> </b></li>
</ul>


<p>The created stylesheets will be added to a public repository - there, they will be freely available
for download and modification by individual users. Additionally, users will be able to upload their own
files into the repository, hence sharing any stylesheets created by themselves with the larger community of users.
</p>

<p>These stylesheets will also be made available (somehow) for use with other commercial products
