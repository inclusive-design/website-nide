<h2>Abstract...</h2>
<p> This paper begins with a summary of the challenges
associated with the communication of mathematics in an auditory
modality. Solutions to these challenges are presented,
forming a functional specification of a usable tool for the
visually disabled. The paper then describes the work being undertaken
by the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC), in collaboration
with IBM Research(*), in extending their Techexplorer Hypermedia
Browser to incorporate these features.
The result promises to be a robust application for
the presentation of mathematical web pages (XHTML and MathML documents),
supporting the features needed for effective communication
within the Screen Reading paradigm.</p>

<hr>

<p> Mathematicians rarely <i>just</i> talk about their work; More
commonly they are found poised and ready around a blackboard, or
hovering about the closest outcropping bemoaning the poor
quality of cocktail napkins. Mathematics is a primarily visual
endeavor; The addition of natural language is an afterthought,
and mostly an incomplete afterthought. Indeed, this is a
difficult matter for accessibility - How can one effectively
communicate a primarily visual matter to the visually disabled?</p>

<h2>Mathematics on the Web...</h2>
<p> Currently, mathematical documents (and mathematically robust
technical documents in general) are generally encoded in TeX, a technical
typesetting language. TeX, however, does not live within the Internet
paradigm - As the Internet grows as a pedagogical tool, so does the need for
mathematical notation to be embedded as an element of a standard web
document. </p>
<p> The solutions currently used are not palatable to the user with
visual disabilities. The inclusion of GIF images (screen shots taken
from some mathematical authoring tool) is most often
entirely inaccessible, with the rare exception that the author includes
some meaningful ALT text, in which case the description's linguistic conventions
change from author to author. The linking of documents encoded in Postscript
is less accessible still, where no ALT text can possibly be included.
Luckily, these options are not palatable to visual users either, due
to the need for additional software, or simply the awkwardness of the
presentation.</p>
<p> The most likely replacement for these approaches is MathML, the W3C's
new XML language for mathematical expressions. MathML is a fully robust
markup for mathematical expressions, capable of visually presenting
virtually any mathematical notation. It also promises full support
within the near future, evident from the claims of the producers
of popular browsers (Indeed, Netscape's beta browser Mozilla already
includes a near-complete implementation), and from plug-ins capable of
rendering the mark-up, such as IBM's Techexplorer Hypermedia Browser.
Given that MathML promises to soon
be the standard for mathematical notation on the web, accessibility
becomes a crucial matter. Accessibility of the content should be
ensured prior to MathML becoming a commonly used tool in
education and academics.</p>

<h2>Current Status of MathML Accessibility...</h2>
<p> The general XML philosophy can be summarized as "the separation of content from
presentation" - from the viewpoint of accessibility, this
is an exciting idea. In this separation, the possibility exists that
content can be easily obtained and presented in a manner suitable
for speech output, Haptics, etc. "The W3C's commitment to lead the Web to its
full potential includes promoting a high degree of usability for
people with disabilities"<sup>5</sup>, unfortunately, is not
easily extended to MathML. The visual nature of mathematical
notation has made it too difficult to distinguish between content and presentation.
While it may be possible for some simple cases, like single-variable
calculus where notation is centuries old and common, modern mathematicians
often invent their own notation for their immediate needs. </p>

<p> Current Screen Readers are simply not designed to deal with this sort
of input. Consider the following scenario: A visually disabled user
is accessing a web page using a standard screen reader,
and a popular browser. Within that page, the author has
included an equation, say:</pr>
<center><img src=eq1.gif alt="GIF image of the unnormalized standard Gaussian"></center>
<p> The MathML is detected, and presented visually. The screen reader comes across
the visual representation, and reads those symbols which it recognizes:
<i>"plus minus x 2 e 2 dx minus"</i>, i.e. a linear reading of all
the common symbols. Unfortunate as this is, it is the reality
of the situation. There is no commonly available tool at present for presenting MathML
accessibly(**).</p>


<h2>The Challenges for Accessible Mathematics...</h2>
<p> The difficulties in presenting mathematics in an auditory
modality are daunting. Putting aside the need for the creation
of a mostly new natural language notation, which agrees with the
existing incomplete one, one quickly discovers challenges:</p>

<p> <b>Two-Dimensional Formatting: </b>
Mathematical notation is designed for visual elegance. In doing
so, mathematicians use a two-dimensional notation. This includes the
extensive use of superscripts and subscripts, elements layered on top of
each other, hats and arrows, etc. This sort of problem becomes immediately
visible when one attempts to read a two-dimensional matrix aloud. Consider
the equation given above: a non-ambiguous reading would need to be
something along the lines of <i>"The integral from minus infinity to positive
infinity of begin-scope e to the power of begin-scope the fraction numerator
negative x raised 2 denominator 2 end-scope dx end-scope"</i>. In these sorts
of situations, the content of the expression is quickly obscured by the
sheer mass of formatting information.</p>

<p> <b>Separation of Content and Presentation: </b>
Although MathML contains a content markup, a robust
reading mechanism cannot assume its use; The need to read
expressions which lie outside of the content markup scope, and
the likely possibility that MathML authoring tools will produce
presentation markup when not strictly necessary guarantee this.
But, presentation markup is widely ambiguous: For example, f(a+b) might
mean "f multiplied by a plus b", or it might mean
"the function f applied to a plus b". Z/2 might mean "one-half zed",
or it might mean "The integers modulo 2". In general, with no assumptions
about context, an automated process can do no better than simply read
a mathematical expression symbol by symbol. Consider the first example
again: <i>"Elongated s superscript (plus infinity-sign) subscript (minus infinity-sign)
e superscript ((minus x superscript 2) over 2) d x"</i>. Again the length of the
expression obscures its content, and fails to agree with existing conventions
for mathematical speech.</p>

<p> <b>Active vs. Passive Access: </b>
When a user visually examines a mathematical expression, he possesses a great deal of control
over his attention. He may first scan the entire equation, then focus on whichever components
he wishes. However, the user listening to a speech synthesizer does not have this level of control.
Stevens and Edwards note that "Listening is essentially a passive process and users of taped
books often complain of lapses in concentration and an overwhelming amount of information to
try to remember... Reading often defaults to a passive reception of information at a
pace dictated by speech"<sup>1</sup>. Raman writes that "The speaker (perhaps on an audio cassette)
reads in a relentless linear fashion, from beginning to end, and the listener simply listens,
with little control over the process"<sup>2</sup>. Mathematical equations are notorious for reaching great
length and complexity - a user needs the ability to easily reread an expression as many times as he
desires, and the option of breaking down that equation into "chunks" - that is, to have the ability
to analyze the surface structure of an expression, then delve into the details of the components.</p>

<h2>The Solutions...</h2>
<p> Solutions for these challenges do exist, and in fact have been implemented.
T.V. Raman's ASTER<sup>3</sup> contains all of the following features, and MathTalk<sup>1</sup>
implements some of the prosody and browsing utilities. These systems are not designed for MathML, however,
and do not readily lend themselves to the Web Browser-Screen Reader paradigm. The conventions
implemented within these systems, however, will be emulated in the discussed system.</p>

<p> <b>Audio Formatted Natural Language: </b>
The problem of emulating two-dimensional notation in a linear format may
be approached by artificially adding another dimension to the audio output.
By controlling the prosody (pitch, rate of speech, etc.), different "modes"
of notation may be encoded without explicit linguistic indicators. For example,
superscripts may be spoken in a higher pitch, subscripts lower. Consider the following
example:</p>
<center><a href=eraisedcomp.wav><img src=eraisedcomp.gif alt="Image of expression e raised minus x plus y raised 2 z. Select to hear audio"></a></center>
<p> Selecting the image will play a proposed audio output for that expression, formatted
according to the preceding rules. Note that explicit indications for
scope were not necessary. Stevens and Edwards, in discussion of MathTalk, note that "the effects of prosody
were... evaluated experimentally and shown to promote the recovery of syntactic structure, enhance
the retention of lexical content and reduce the mental workload involved".</p>

<p> <b>User Context Selection: </b>
The separation of content and presentation problem may be dealt with using a mechanism
for user context selection: That is, a process by which pattern-matching rules may be added
to the system. These pattern-matching rules would find common occurrences and replace them with
meaningful short-cuts. For example, Z/2 with no assumptions must be read "Z over 2". If the user
realizes that the given context of a paper is arithmetic, he might load a set of arithmetic rules,
which might contain the rule */2 -> "one-half *". At this point, the system would read "one-half z",
leading to a more immediate recognition. The need exists for pre-defined context rule sets for
all the major fields of mathematics, as well as the inclusion of a routine for user-defined rule sets.
Through this means, a user could respond to a new or unsupported field of mathematics by creating
his own set of rules, with which he could hear a set of documents.</p>

<p> <b>Document Browsing: </b>
While audio formatting might aid in the grasping of syntactic structure, it is
not sufficient to introduce a robust mechanism for the processing of mathematical
notation. The need to return control over the pace and order of the reading
is essential - one way to accomplish this is through a "document Tokenizer", that is,
a mechanism for breaking up a document into smaller and logically ordered chunks, more
simply processed by a listener. In adding the ability to browse those tokens in any order,
the listener is transferred into an active role, controlling which elements are re-read
and which are skipped. </p>

<h2>Extensions to IBM's Techexplorer...</h2>
<p> Let us reconsider the initial scenario. The user is browsing a web page containing
a MathML expression, which is recognized by the Techexplorer plug-in, and alerts
her of the existence of a mathematical expression. The user then activates
the reading utility, which:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Parses the page, breaking up the file into tokens (either on the basis of
  each formula, or some finer division)</li>
  <li> Applies any selected contexts (existing or user defined files containing rules for
  pattern matching and replacement) to the
  mathematical tokens, replacing patterns of presentation tags with other
  more meaningful elements</li>
  <li> Formats the mathematical tokens according to some standard set of audio
  (prosody) formatting rules</li>
  <li> Creates player controls for those tokens </li>
</ul>
<p> At this point our user may activate the tokens (i.e. command them to be read), one by one, or
ask that the entire document be read. She may also reread tokens, cycle forward or backward
through those tokens, or load some new (pre-defined or immediately created) context to deal
with the MathML.</p>
<p> Through the parsing of the document, Techexplorer hopes to provide some rudimentary
active listening to the user, returning some of the control lost in the use of a
passive medium. The use of audio formatting will recreate some of the
visual elegance lost in conversion to linear form. Inclusion of context-selection
routines can provide the user means of escaping the presentation markup, both
through standard included sets of rules, and through user-defined sets tailored for particular
cases.</p>

<h2>About the Extension...</h2>
<p> The extension consists of four steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Subdivision of the MathML components into tokens</li>
  <li> Applying context rules to those tokens</li>
  <li> Transforming those tokens into an Audio Formatted Natural Language (AFNL)</li>
  <li> Transmitting those results to a reader </li>
</ul>
<p> The subdivision into tokens will be a highly customizable process. Although a default
procedure will be included, that is, one which simply breaks up a document according
to formulas, it is expected that users will prefer a finer level of division. The extension will
support user-customized general rules, as well as real-time settings for this step.</p>
<p> Both the application of context rules, and the transformation of tokens into AFNL will
consist of an XSL transformation. These transformations will either use one of the base included
system stylesheets, or any stylesheet provided by the user. While Techexplorer is a
proprietary system, these stylesheets will be free and publicly available.</p>
<p>
The final step is the transmission of the resulting AFNL to a speech synthesizer.
The extension is primarily intended for use with IBM's ViaVoice Speech System, and the
Techexplorer user interface will include accessible controls for transmitting to this system.
Additionally, Techexplorer will be packaged with a public API - this API will
include procedures for the conversion of MathML to several AFNLs, including CSS 2-augmented
XHTML.</p>

<h2>Future Prospects...</h2>
<p>The procedure above is specifically designed to support standardization within the
realm of spoken mathematics. The public availability of the stylesheets will allow
not only for user customization of the audio rendering rules, but also for use in
other forthcoming audio mathematics systems - if used, clients need not deal
with differing audio presentations between software packages. The addition of a public API
will allow for easy inclusion of the audio rendering within other self-voicing
applications, again allowing for standardization, and for the inclusion of
audio mathematics into systems where previously this was an impossibility.</p>
<p>Additionally, the public stylesheet system is particularly suited for
online resource sharing. It is hoped that in the future there may exist some public repository
where students and educators may share their customizations for the various
branches of mathematics and notations.</p>
